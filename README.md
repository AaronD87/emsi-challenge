## Emsi Code Challenge

This project is for interviewing at EMSI, below you will find installation instructions and a recap of project guidelines. This project was created with React, Axios, NPM, SCSS, Prettier and Travis CI

## Installation Instructions

Before starting the project be sure to have your own API key from [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/). You will be using this to create a .env file in the root of the project following the .env.example file. 

```
$ cd emsi-challenge
$ npm i
$ npm start
$ open your browser and go to localhost:3000
```

You may also visit the deployed project [here](https://aarond87.github.io/emsi-challenge).

## Project Guidelines

In this project, we want you to recreate a React App that displays institutions’ information. Attached is an image mockup of what the final product will look like.

Your goal is to recreate the mockup to the best of your ability. We expect you to use React, but you are free to use whatever packages or methods of styling that you wish. However, you shouldn’t use any existing component library.

Include the first 100 resultant schools for your query. You need not include more than this.

## Requirements

- You must put your code on to GitHub. We will review it from there.
- Use small commits to git so that we can see how you’ve developed your solution.
- Follow good coding practices, and add comments if necessary for clarity.
- You must use React to develop the project.
- Please include a `README.md` file that outlines how to run your project, and any additional notes you may have.

## Evaluation Criteria

- How readable your code is
- How close the final product is to the mockup (we aren't expecting by-the-pixel perfection)
- How your solution handles the API
- How well you talk through your decisions in code review

## The following is included with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
